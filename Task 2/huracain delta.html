                    Hurricane Delta has made landfall in the US state of Louisiana, 
                    which is still recovering from the damage caused by a previous hurricane in August.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the 10th named storm to make US landfall so far this year, 
                    breaking a record that has stood since 1916.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Delta hit Creole, Louisiana as a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 local time 
                    (00:00 BST) on Friday, with winds of 100 mph (155 km/h).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It weakened to a Category 1 as it moved inland, causing widespread power cuts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) also warned of an eight-foot-high 
                    "life-threatening storm surge" across the Louisiana coast, caused by high winds 
                    from Delta.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hurricane first made landfall near Puerto Morelos on Mexico's Caribbean coast 
                    on Wednesday, forcing thousands of tourists and residents to move into shelters 
                    for safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having crossed the Gulf of Mexico, Delta is now moving across central and 
                    north-eastern Louisiana, and will enter northern Mississippi and the Tennessee 
                    Valley on Saturday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Rapid weakening is expected overnight and Saturday," the NHC said. "Delta is 
                    forecast to weaken to a tropical storm tonight and to a tropical depression on 
                    Saturday."

                    Parts of the state were already severely storm-damaged from the more powerful Category 
                    4 Hurricane Laura, which ripped through homes and uprooted trees when it hit on 20 August.

                    More than 6,000 people are still displaced and living in temporary accommodation, such

                    Streets in cities such as Lake Charles, which was particularly badly-hit by Hurricane

                    Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter told Reuters news agency that Hurricane Laura "is still 
                    very fresh and very raw, and I think that had something to do with more people evacuating 
                    for Delta".

                <p>
                    "In this community, there are a lot of homes that were damaged and so a lot of people are 
                    concerned about staying in that structure again," he added.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Governor Edwards also previously warned that although Delta was less strong than Laura, 
                    it could sweep up debris from the previous hurricane and hurl it like missiles.
